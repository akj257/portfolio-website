    <p>Cryptocurrency is digital or virtual money that uses cryptography for security and operates on decentralized networks called blockchains.
         It enables peer-to-peer transactions without the need for intermediaries like banks, offering potential advantages such as fast and cheap international transfers. Popular cryptocurrencies include Bitcoin and Ethereum. 
        However, they're also known for their price volatility and regulatory uncertainties.
